Description: The pattern of digestion and protection from DNA nucleases such 
    as DNAse I, micrococcal nuclease, and Tn5 transposase can be used to 
    infer the location of associated proteins. This package contains useful 
    functions to analyze patterns of paired-end sequencing fragment density. 
    VplotR facilitates the generation of V-plots and footprint profiles 
    over single or aggregated genomic loci of interest.
